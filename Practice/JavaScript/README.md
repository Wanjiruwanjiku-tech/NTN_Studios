# LEARNING JAVASCRIPT AND TYPESCRIPT

[Phase One](#phase-one)

# PHASE ONE
## Build core JavaScript Intuition.
### Goal: Understand Syntax, data types and control flows.
### Duration: week 1 to week 2

- JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language with __first-class__ fulctions. Meaning the functions in js are treated like any other variable, meaning it can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned and can be assigned as a value.

1. __Variables__
- Think of Variables as labeled containers that can hold items within them. These items include things like words, numbers or lists.
- Modern ways of creating/declaring variables include using the __let and const__ key words. __Let__ is used if the value stored in the variable can change and __const__ is used if the value is permanent.

```const myVar = 'Hello World';```
```let myVar = 'Hello World';```

2. __Data Types__
- JavaScript works with different kinds of data. Commonly used types include
    a. String = names, words ("Hello"/'Hello')
    b. Number = Whole numbers or decimals (2, 46, 4.8)
    c. Boolean = true, false values
    d. Arrays = list of items (["lion", "Elephant", "monkey"])
    e. Object = key-value items ({name:"Nat", age:28})

3. __Operators__
- These symbols help you work with values
    a. math
    b. logic
    c. assignment

4. __Control Flow__
- Use if/else statements to make decisions in your story/code.

5. __loops__
- Used for repetition, perfect for reusing logic in code.
